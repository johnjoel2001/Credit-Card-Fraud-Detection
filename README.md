# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

This model will detect whether the transaction is fair or fradulent.
I used only ML to make this model.
I applied some pre-processing techniques. Actually the dataset was imbalanced so I had to undersample it.
Basically, I used GridSearhCV to determine which model yields a better score.
I found out that Random Forest gives a better accuracy than the svm and Logistic Regression.
